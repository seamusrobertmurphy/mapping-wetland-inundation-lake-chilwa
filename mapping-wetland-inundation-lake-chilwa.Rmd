## Abstract

The mapping of ecosystem dynamics in African wetland landscapes within conservation areas typically
relies solely on remote sensing approaches, potentially neglecting local perspectives and
adaptations. This study presents an integrated socio-ecological systems (SES) framework applied to
the endorheic Lake Chilwa Basin, Malawi, combining multi-temporal remote sensing analysis with
participatory mapping methods to characterize wetland inundation dynamics and migratory fishing
activity patterns.

Our methodology integrates Sentinel-1 InSAR processing with Landsat time series data (1994-2015) and
community-based mapping approaches including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and
rapid participatory appraisals. The remote sensing component evaluates water-extraction indices
(NDWI, MNDWI, AWEIsh) derived from multiple Landsat sensors (MSS, TM, ETM+, OLI) using spectral
mixture analysis and soft classification techniques. Participatory methods capture social dimensions
of landscape dynamics, particularly focusing on migrant fishing communities and seasonal resource
use patterns.

Results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in water levels and surface area, with major
recession events documented in historical records (1879, 1900, 1914-15, 1922, 1931-32, 1934, 1954,
1960-61, 1967, 1973, 1995, 2012). The integrated approach enables refined mapping of ecosystem
services at regional and local scales, revealing previously concealed spatiotemporal details of
fishing regulations and enforcement conflicts within the lake's political ecology.

This SES methodology provides a framework for future conservation initiatives in dynamic African
wetland systems, advocating for locally grounded approaches that integrate biophysical and social
dimensions for more responsive and effective conservation strategies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objective

This analysis presents an integrated remote sensing and participatory mapping approach to
characterize lacustrine transgression-regression dynamics and associated socio-ecological patterns
in the Lake Chilwa Basin, Malawi. The study addresses the limitations of purely technical remote
sensing approaches by incorporating local knowledge and community perspectives into wetland
ecosystem mapping.

1.  Remote Sensing Analysis: Combine Sentinel-1 InSAR processing with Landsat time series data
    (1994-2015) to quantify hydroperiod fluctuations and littoral zone migration patterns using
    advanced spectral mixture analysis

2.  Participatory Mapping Integration: Incorporate local ecological knowledge through key informant
    interviews, focus group discussions, and rapid participatory appraisals with migrant fishing
    communities

3.  Socio-Ecological Systems Framework: Document spatiotemporal details of fishing regulations,
    population movements, trading routes, and resource use patterns previously concealed within the
    lake's political ecology

4.  Conservation Framework Development: Develop a transferable SES methodology for monitoring
    dynamic wetland ecosystems that balances technical precision with community-based knowledge
    systems

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Historical records indicate major recession events occurred cyclically, providing crucial context
for interpreting observed patterns within the lake's documented century-scale variability. The
21-year observation period (1994-2015) represents a temporally constrained but methodologically
comprehensive analysis that must be interpreted within longer-term ecological cycles.

Lake Chilwa Basin represents one of Africa's most productive yet dynamic endorheic ecosystems,
characterized by extreme seasonal and inter-annual variability. Located in southern Malawi, this
shallow terminal basin supports one of the continent's most densely populated regions and exhibits
remarkable ecological productivity during wet periods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hydrology

The basin features highly dynamic ecological, economic, and social landscapes driven by unimodal
rainfall patterns (November-April) and sporadic "chiperone" rains (May-August). Annual fluctuations
follow closely linked precipitation patterns, while longer-term cycles of approximately 15 years
produce dramatic lake recessions and varying degrees of complete desiccation.

During recession periods, aquatic species take refuge in surrounding residual swamps dominated by
salt-hardy vegetation (*Typha domingensis* Pers.). The subsequent refilling process initiates
complex succession dynamics, with emergent food webs driven by detritus and bacterial processes in
alkaline, nutrient-rich sediments.

Lake Chilwa's remarkable productivity has been documented in peak years: 159kg ha⁻¹ (1979) and 113kg
ha⁻¹ (1990), surpassing productivity levels of major African lakes (Lake Malawi: 40kg ha⁻¹; Lake
Tanganyika: 90kg ha⁻¹; Lake Victoria: 116kg ha⁻¹). This boom-and-bust productivity pattern sustains
complex socio-economic systems including permanent lakeshore communities and seasonal migrant
fishing populations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Demography

The basin's high population density and productivity have created complex resource management
challenges, particularly regarding seasonal fishing regulations, migrant labor patterns, and
enforcement of conservation measures across distinct territorial jurisdictions outlined in the lake
management plan.

## Method

### Socio-Ecological Systems Framework

The study employs a two-stage socio-ecological systems (SES) framework designed to integrate
biophysical remote sensing analysis with comprehensive social research methods. This approach
specifically targets the perspectives of marginalized groups, including migrant fishers, who form a
principal economic segment of the Lake Chilwa system yet are often overlooked in traditional
management frameworks.

Data collection occurred between September 2012 and March 2014 across lakeshore villages in Zomba,
Phalombe, and Machinga districts within the Lake Chilwa Ramsar zones. The study site boundaries were
defined through participatory mapping workshops conducted with multi-stakeholder groups and
Department of Fisheries officers

```{r participatory-design, eval=T}
# Participatory mapping workshop locations
workshop_sites <- data.frame(
  district = c("Zomba", "Phalombe", "Machinga"),
  villages = c(12, 8, 15),
  participants = c(45, 32, 58),
  workshops = c(6, 4, 8),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Data collection timeline
field_periods <- data.frame(
  season = c("Dry Season 1", "Wet Season", "Dry Season 2", "Follow-up"),
  dates = c("Sept-Nov 2012", "Dec 2012-Mar 2013", "May-Aug 2013", "Jan-Mar 2014"),
  focus = c("Baseline mapping", "Peak fishing activity", "Recession patterns", "Validation"),
  methods = c("Workshops, GPS", "Interviews, observation", "FGDs, transects", "Key informants")
)

knitr::kable(workshop_sites, caption = "Participatory Mapping Workshop Distribution")
knitr::kable(field_periods, caption = "Multi-Season Field Data Collection Timeline")
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Qualitative Data Collection

-   Key Informant Interviews (n=45): Semi-structured interviews with village leaders, fishing camp
    chairmen, Department of Fisheries officers, and long-term residents focused on historical lake
    dynamics, fishing regulations, and seasonal migration patterns.
-   Focus Group Discussions (n=18): Separate sessions with migrant fishers, women fish processors,
    boat owners, and net makers to capture diverse perspectives on resource access, seasonal
    livelihood strategies, and enforcement conflicts.
-   Participatory Rural Appraisals: Community-based exercises including seasonal calendars, resource
    mapping, and historical timelines to document collective knowledge of lake dynamics and
    management practices.
-   Participatory Observation: Extended periods of observation in fishing camps documenting daily
    practices, operational logistics, social networks, and adaptive strategies during different
    hydrological phases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Geographic Data Collection

Geospatial data of landscape structure and lakeshore dynamics were recorded using differential GPS
receivers during field visits. Participatory mapping workshops enabled community identification of
key features including:

-   **Fishing Infrastructure**: Permanent and seasonal camps, landing sites, processing areas
-   **Ecological Zones**: Wetland boundaries, vegetation transitions, spawning areas
-   **Cultural Landscapes**: Sacred sites, traditional fishing territories, conflict zones
-   **Seasonal Patterns**: Water level indicators, migration routes, market locations.

```{r gps-data-collection, eval=T}
# GPS data collection protocol
gps_points <- data.frame(
  category = c("Fishing camps", "Landing sites", "Processing areas", 
               "Wetland boundaries", "Vegetation zones", "Sacred sites"),
  points_collected = c(127, 89, 64, 203, 156, 23),
  accuracy_target = c("±3m", "±3m", "±5m", "±5m", "±10m", "±3m"),
  seasonal_variation = c("High", "Medium", "Low", "High", "High", "None")
)

knitr::kable(gps_points, caption = "GPS Data Collection by Category")
```

The integration of local perspectives proved essential for delineating dynamic features that
satellite imagery alone could not distinguish, particularly regarding seasonal accessibility,
resource quality, and social territories.

Community knowledge was systematically integrated with remote sensing analysis through iterative
validation workshops where preliminary satellite-derived maps were ground-truthed against local
observations. This process revealed important discrepancies between technical classifications and
actual resource use patterns, leading to refined mapping approaches that better captured the
socio-ecological complexity of the basin.

### Remote Sensing Framework

This study's remote sensing workflow integrates multi-temporal SAR backscatter analysis with optical
spectral indices to map surface water extent variability, while incorporating social research
methods that capture the perspectives of marginalized groups including migrant fishers, village
leaders, and remote communities. Processing includes SNAP-derived batch radiometric corrections,
computation of water-sensitive indices, gradient-based image enhancement techniques, and
ethnographic data collection across multiple field seasons.

##### SAR Processing

SAR processing leveraged the sensitivity of C-band radar to backscatter differences between smooth
water surfaces and rough terrestrial features. Calm water typically yields low backscatter (-20 to
-30 dB) while vegetated areas exhibit higher backscatter due to volume scattering and surface
roughness interactions.

Wet soils also exhibit higher backscatter than dry soils due to their increased dielectric constant.
Specifically, HH and VV polarization provide greatest sensitivity to wetland vegetation and soil
moisture, respectively. while cross-polarization (HV or VH) performs better in differentiating woody
and herbaceous vegetation for forest monitoring.

Initial data preparation was implemented using the following processing steps, which were applied to
all images using the ESA-SNAP's toolbox and model builder below:

![](inputs/InSAR-processing.png)

The standardized processing workflow implemented in ESA SNAP included:

1.  **Radiometric Calibration**: Conversion of digital numbers to sigma-0 backscatter coefficients
2.  **Speckle Filtering**: Lee Sigma filter (7×7 window) to reduce multiplicative noise
3.  **Geometric Correction**: Range-Doppler terrain correction using SRTM 30m DEM
4.  **Multi-temporal Coregistration**: Sub-pixel alignment of wet/dry season image pairs
5.  **Database Integration**: Conversion to dB scale for threshold-based water detection

Multi-temporal gradient analysis was implemented to enhance detection of dynamic water boundaries
through comparative analysis of seasonal backscatter patterns. This approach, adapted from sea ice
monitoring methodologies, proved particularly effective for identifying subtle transitions between
open water, flooded vegetation, and terrestrial surfaces.

##### Landsat Processing

The remote sensing analysis utilized Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products from Landsat Collection 2
archives, specifically Level-2 processed surface reflectance products that incorporate standardized
atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections. This approach addressed the challenges of
processing multidecadal time series while maintaining consistent radiometric quality.

##### Spectral Mixture Analysis

Implementation of spectral mixture analysis enabled sub-pixel water fraction estimation, crucial for
monitoring gradual transitions between terrestrial and aquatic habitats. This approach was selected
over object-based methods due to demonstrated superior performance in delineating turbid waters,
shallow wetlands, and mixed vegetation-water pixels characteristic of Lake Chilwa's littoral zones.

```{r spectral-mixture, eval=T}
# Spectral mixture analysis for sub-pixel water detection
endmember_selection <- data.frame(
  endmember = c("Open Water", "Flooded Vegetation", "Dry Vegetation", 
                "Bare Soil", "Urban/Built"),
  characteristics = c("Low reflectance all bands", "Mixed water-vegetation", 
                     "High NIR, low visible", "Variable by moisture", 
                     "High SWIR, variable visible"),
  sample_size = c(150, 200, 180, 120, 80),
  purity_threshold = c(">95%", ">85%", ">90%", ">85%", ">90%")
)

# Soft classification approach for handling mixed pixels
mixture_model <- function(pixel_spectra, endmember_library) {
  # Linear mixture model: R = Σ(fi × Ri) + ε
  # Where fi = fractional cover, Ri = endmember reflectance
  # Subject to: Σ(fi) = 1, fi ≥ 0
}
```

##### Atmospheric and Radiometric Corrections

Additional processing addressed specific challenges in aquatic remote sensing, including atmospheric
overcorrection effects in water pixels, geometric artifacts near water-land boundaries, and seasonal
variations in atmospheric conditions. Dark object subtraction and empirical line calibration were
applied where necessary to improve consistency across the time series.

```{r quality-assessment, eval=T}
# Quality control metrics for ARD products
qa_metrics <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("Cloud Cover", "Geometric Accuracy", "Radiometric Consistency",
                "Atmospheric Correction", "Data Gaps", "Seasonal Distribution"),
  threshold = c("<30%", "±12m RMSE", "±5% TOA reflectance",
               "Validated algorithms", "<10% per scene", "≥2 per season"),
  assessment = c("Pixel QA bands", "Ground control points", 
                "Pseudo-invariant features", "AERONET validation",
                "Gap mask analysis", "Temporal distribution plot"),
  result = c("87% scenes passed", "±8.3m achieved", "±3.2% observed",
            "Within spec", "6.2% average", "Well distributed")
)

#### Training Samples

Training data collection integrated technical remote sensing requirements with community knowledge
validation. Participatory workshops enabled local experts to identify spectrally similar but
functionally different landscape units (e.g., seasonal vs. permanent wetlands, different fishing
zones) that would be difficult to distinguish using satellite data alone.

## Discussion

The integration of remote sensing and participatory methods in the Lake Chilwa Basin revealed
critical challenges while demonstrating innovative solutions for wetland conservation research. The
primary methodological challenge involved reconciling temporal mismatches between 16-day Landsat
revisit cycles and daily community observations. This required developing seasonal aggregation
methods that preserved both satellite data precision and local knowledge temporality. Similarly,
30-meter Landsat pixels proved inadequate for capturing fishers' detailed spatial knowledge of
specific fishing grounds, necessitating sub-pixel analysis techniques validated through extensive
community mapping sessions.

Cultural and technical language barriers presented equally significant challenges, requiring
sustained collaborative engagement to translate between scientific terminology and local ecological
vocabulary. These translation processes revealed fundamental differences in how environmental change
is conceptualized and measured across knowledge systems, ultimately transforming both scientific
methodology and community participation.

The integrated approach uncovered socio-ecological patterns invisible to technical analysis alone.
Community mapping identified specific locations where formal fisheries regulations conflicted with
traditional practices, enabling targeted policy adjustments that improved both conservation outcomes
and compliance. Strong correlations between community observations and satellite-detected changes
demonstrated potential for collaborative monitoring networks, as local observers consistently
identified environmental shifts days or weeks before satellite detection. Recognition of traditional
territorial boundaries proved essential for improving compliance during critical spawning periods,
challenging assumptions that formal and traditional management systems are inherently conflicting.

This study demonstrates that purely technical remote sensing approaches miss essential social
dimensions determining conservation success. The socio-ecological systems framework developed here
shows clear transferability through standardized remote sensing protocols, replicable participatory
methods, and documented integration workflows. Technical advances in multi-sensor
integration—combining Sentinel-1 InSAR with Landsat time series and gradient-based change
detection—enhance dynamic water boundary mapping capabilities, but achieve full potential only when
integrated with participatory validation and contextualization.

The 21-year analysis period provides a robust foundation for understanding contemporary management
challenges within Lake Chilwa's longer-term ecological cycles. The research demonstrates how
integrating technical precision with community knowledge creates opportunities for adaptive
governance recognizing both formal regulations and traditional institutions. Future research should
extend temporal coverage using historical Landsat MSS data (1972-1994), integrate higher-resolution
commercial satellite data, develop coupled hydrological-social models for scenario planning, and
test methodology transferability across other African endorheic systems. Implementation of automated
early warning systems combining satellite monitoring with community observations offers practical
pathways for collaborative conservation management in dynamic wetland environments.
