## 0.1 Abstract

The mapping of ecosystem dynamics in African wetland landscapes within
conservation areas typically relies solely on remote sensing approaches,
potentially neglecting local perspectives and adaptations. This study
presents an integrated socio-ecological systems (SES) framework applied
to the endorheic Lake Chilwa Basin, Malawi, combining multi-temporal
remote sensing analysis with participatory mapping methods to
characterize wetland inundation dynamics and migratory fishing activity
patterns.

Our methodology integrates Sentinel-1 InSAR processing with Landsat time
series data (1994-2015) and community-based mapping approaches including
key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and rapid
participatory appraisals. The remote sensing component evaluates
water-extraction indices (NDWI, MNDWI, AWEIsh) derived from multiple
Landsat sensors (MSS, TM, ETM+, OLI) using spectral mixture analysis and
soft classification techniques. Participatory methods capture social
dimensions of landscape dynamics, particularly focusing on migrant
fishing communities and seasonal resource use patterns.

Results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in water levels and
surface area, with major recession events documented in historical
records (1879, 1900, 1914-15, 1922, 1931-32, 1934, 1954, 1960-61, 1967,
1973, 1995, 2012). The integrated approach enables refined mapping of
ecosystem services at regional and local scales, revealing previously
concealed spatiotemporal details of fishing regulations and enforcement
conflicts within the lake’s political ecology.

This SES methodology provides a framework for future conservation
initiatives in dynamic African wetland systems, advocating for locally
grounded approaches that integrate biophysical and social dimensions for
more responsive and effective conservation strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0.2 Objective

This analysis presents an integrated remote sensing and participatory
mapping approach to characterize lacustrine transgression-regression
dynamics and associated socio-ecological patterns in the Lake Chilwa
Basin, Malawi. The study addresses the limitations of purely technical
remote sensing approaches by incorporating local knowledge and community
perspectives into wetland ecosystem mapping.

1.  Remote Sensing Analysis: Combine Sentinel-1 InSAR processing with
    Landsat time series data (1994-2015) to quantify hydroperiod
    fluctuations and littoral zone migration patterns using advanced
    spectral mixture analysis

2.  Participatory Mapping Integration: Incorporate local ecological
    knowledge through key informant interviews, focus group discussions,
    and rapid participatory appraisals with migrant fishing communities

3.  Socio-Ecological Systems Framework: Document spatiotemporal details
    of fishing regulations, population movements, trading routes, and
    resource use patterns previously concealed within the lake’s
    political ecology

4.  Conservation Framework Development: Develop a transferable SES
    methodology for monitoring dynamic wetland ecosystems that balances
    technical precision with community-based knowledge systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0.3 Introduction

Historical records indicate major recession events occurred cyclically,
providing crucial context for interpreting observed patterns within the
lake’s documented century-scale variability. The 21-year observation
period (1994-2015) represents a temporally constrained but
methodologically comprehensive analysis that must be interpreted within
longer-term ecological cycles.

Lake Chilwa Basin represents one of Africa’s most productive yet dynamic
endorheic ecosystems, characterized by extreme seasonal and inter-annual
variability. Located in southern Malawi, this shallow terminal basin
supports one of the continent’s most densely populated regions and
exhibits remarkable ecological productivity during wet periods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 0.3.2 Hydrology

The basin features highly dynamic ecological, economic, and social
landscapes driven by unimodal rainfall patterns (November-April) and
sporadic “chiperone” rains (May-August). Annual fluctuations follow
closely linked precipitation patterns, while longer-term cycles of
approximately 15 years produce dramatic lake recessions and varying
degrees of complete desiccation.

During recession periods, aquatic species take refuge in surrounding
residual swamps dominated by salt-hardy vegetation (*Typha domingensis*
Pers.). The subsequent refilling process initiates complex succession
dynamics, with emergent food webs driven by detritus and bacterial
processes in alkaline, nutrient-rich sediments.

Lake Chilwa’s remarkable productivity has been documented in peak years:
159kg ha⁻¹ (1979) and 113kg ha⁻¹ (1990), surpassing productivity levels
of major African lakes (Lake Malawi: 40kg ha⁻¹; Lake Tanganyika: 90kg
ha⁻¹; Lake Victoria: 116kg ha⁻¹). This boom-and-bust productivity
pattern sustains complex socio-economic systems including permanent
lakeshore communities and seasonal migrant fishing populations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 0.3.3 Demography

The basin’s high population density and productivity have created
complex resource management challenges, particularly regarding seasonal
fishing regulations, migrant labor patterns, and enforcement of
conservation measures across distinct territorial jurisdictions outlined
in the lake management plan.

## 0.4 Method

### 0.4.1 Socio-Ecological Systems Framework

The study employs a two-stage socio-ecological systems (SES) framework
designed to integrate biophysical remote sensing analysis with
comprehensive social research methods. This approach specifically
targets the perspectives of marginalized groups, including migrant
fishers, who form a principal economic segment of the Lake Chilwa system
yet are often overlooked in traditional management frameworks.

Data collection occurred between September 2012 and March 2014 across
lakeshore villages in Zomba, Phalombe, and Machinga districts within the
Lake Chilwa Ramsar zones. The study site boundaries were defined through
participatory mapping workshops conducted with multi-stakeholder groups
and Department of Fisheries officers

``` r
# Participatory mapping workshop locations
workshop_sites <- data.frame(
  district = c("Zomba", "Phalombe", "Machinga"),
  villages = c(12, 8, 15),
  participants = c(45, 32, 58),
  workshops = c(6, 4, 8),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

  season = c("Dry Season 1", "Wet Season", "Dry Season 2", "Follow-up"),
  dates = c("Sept-Nov 2012", "Dec 2012-Mar 2013", "May-Aug 2013", "Jan-Mar 2014"),
  focus = c("Baseline mapping", "Peak fishing activity", "Recession patterns", "Validation"),
  methods = c("Workshops, GPS", "Interviews, observation", "FGDs, transects", "Key informants")
)

Multi-Season Field Data Collection Timeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 0.4.1.0.1 Qualitative Data Collection

- Key Informant Interviews (n=45): Semi-structured interviews with
  village leaders, fishing camp chairmen, Department of Fisheries
  officers, and long-term residents focused on historical lake dynamics,
  fishing regulations, and seasonal migration patterns.
- Focus Group Discussions (n=18): Separate sessions with migrant
  fishers, women fish processors, boat owners, and net makers to capture
  diverse perspectives on resource access, seasonal livelihood
  strategies, and enforcement conflicts.
- Participatory Rural Appraisals: Community-based exercises including
  seasonal calendars, resource mapping, and historical timelines to
  document collective knowledge of lake dynamics and management
  practices.
- Participatory Observation: Extended periods of observation in fishing
  camps documenting daily practices, operational logistics, social
  networks, and adaptive strategies during different hydrological
  phases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 0.4.1.0.2 Geographic Data Collection

Geospatial data of landscape structure and lakeshore dynamics were
recorded using differential GPS receivers during field visits.
Participatory mapping workshops enabled community identification of key
features including:

- **Fishing Infrastructure**: Permanent and seasonal camps, landing
  sites, processing areas
- **Ecological Zones**: Wetland boundaries, vegetation transitions,
  spawning areas
- **Cultural Landscapes**: Sacred sites, traditional fishing
  territories, conflict zones
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Water level indicators, migration routes,
  market locations.

GPS Data Collection by Category

The integration of local perspectives proved essential for delineating
dynamic features that satellite imagery alone could not distinguish,
particularly regarding seasonal accessibility, resource quality, and
social territories.

Community knowledge was systematically integrated with remote sensing
analysis through iterative validation workshops where preliminary
satellite-derived maps were ground-truthed against local observations.
This process revealed important discrepancies between technical
classifications and actual resource use patterns, leading to refined
mapping approaches that better captured the socio-ecological complexity
of the basin.

### 0.4.2 Remote Sensing Framework

This study’s remote sensing workflow integrates multi-temporal SAR
backscatter analysis with optical spectral indices to map surface water
extent variability, while incorporating social research methods that
capture the perspectives of marginalized groups including migrant
fishers, village leaders, and remote communities. Processing includes
SNAP-derived batch radiometric corrections, computation of
water-sensitive indices, gradient-based image enhancement techniques,
and ethnographic data collection across multiple field seasons.

##### 0.4.2.0.1 SAR Processing

SAR processing leveraged the sensitivity of C-band radar to backscatter
differences between smooth water surfaces and rough terrestrial
features. Calm water typically yields low backscatter (-20 to -30 dB)
while vegetated areas exhibit higher backscatter due to volume
scattering and surface roughness interactions.

Wet soils also exhibit higher backscatter than dry soils due to their
increased dielectric constant. Specifically, HH and VV polarization
provide greatest sensitivity to wetland vegetation and soil moisture,
respectively. while cross-polarization (HV or VH) performs better in
differentiating woody and herbaceous vegetation for forest monitoring.

Initial data preparation was implemented using the following processing
steps, which were applied to all images using the ESA-SNAP’s toolbox and
model builder below:

![](inputs/InSAR-processing.png)

The standardized processing workflow implemented in ESA SNAP included:

1.  **Radiometric Calibration**: Conversion of digital numbers to
    sigma-0 backscatter coefficients
2.  **Speckle Filtering**: Lee Sigma filter (7×7 window) to reduce
    multiplicative noise
3.  **Geometric Correction**: Range-Doppler terrain correction using
    SRTM 30m DEM
4.  **Multi-temporal Coregistration**: Sub-pixel alignment of wet/dry
    season image pairs
5.  **Database Integration**: Conversion to dB scale for threshold-based
    water detection

Multi-temporal gradient analysis was implemented to enhance detection of
dynamic water boundaries through comparative analysis of seasonal
backscatter patterns. This approach, adapted from sea ice monitoring
methodologies, proved particularly effective for identifying subtle
transitions between open water, flooded vegetation, and terrestrial
surfaces.

##### 0.4.2.0.2 Landsat Processing

The remote sensing analysis utilized Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products
from Landsat Collection 2 archives, specifically Level-2 processed
surface reflectance products that incorporate standardized atmospheric,
radiometric, and geometric corrections. This approach addressed the
challenges of processing multidecadal time series while maintaining
consistent radiometric quality.

##### 0.4.2.0.4 Spectral Mixture Analysis

Implementation of spectral mixture analysis enabled sub-pixel water
fraction estimation, crucial for monitoring gradual transitions between
terrestrial and aquatic habitats. This approach was selected over
object-based methods due to demonstrated superior performance in
delineating turbid waters, shallow wetlands, and mixed vegetation-water
pixels characteristic of Lake Chilwa’s littoral zones.

``` r
# Spectral mixture analysis for sub-pixel water detection
endmember_selection <- data.frame(
  endmember = c("Open Water", "Flooded Vegetation", "Dry Vegetation", 
                "Bare Soil", "Urban/Built"),
  characteristics = c("Low reflectance all bands", "Mixed water-vegetation", 
                     "High NIR, low visible", "Variable by moisture", 
                     "High SWIR, variable visible"),
  sample_size = c(150, 200, 180, 120, 80),
  purity_threshold = c(">95%", ">85%", ">90%", ">85%", ">90%")
)

# Soft classification approach for handling mixed pixels
mixture_model <- function(pixel_spectra, endmember_library) {
  # Linear mixture model: R = Σ(fi × Ri) + ε
  # Where fi = fractional cover, Ri = endmember reflectance
  # Subject to: Σ(fi) = 1, fi ≥ 0
}
```

##### 0.4.2.0.5 Atmospheric and Radiometric Corrections

Additional processing addressed specific challenges in aquatic remote
sensing, including atmospheric overcorrection effects in water pixels,
geometric artifacts near water-land boundaries, and seasonal variations
in atmospheric conditions. Dark object subtraction and empirical line
calibration were applied where necessary to improve consistency across
the time series.

``` r
# Quality control metrics for ARD products
qa_metrics <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("Cloud Cover", "Geometric Accuracy", "Radiometric Consistency",
                "Atmospheric Correction", "Data Gaps", "Seasonal Distribution"),
  threshold = c("<30%", "±12m RMSE", "±5% TOA reflectance",

## 0.6 Discussion

The integration of remote sensing and participatory methods in the Lake
Chilwa Basin revealed critical challenges while demonstrating innovative
solutions for wetland conservation research. The primary methodological
challenge involved reconciling temporal mismatches between 16-day
Landsat revisit cycles and daily community observations. This required
developing seasonal aggregation methods that preserved both satellite
data precision and local knowledge temporality. Similarly, 30-meter
Landsat pixels proved inadequate for capturing fishers’ detailed spatial
knowledge of specific fishing grounds, necessitating sub-pixel analysis
techniques validated through extensive community mapping sessions.

Cultural and technical language barriers presented equally significant
challenges, requiring sustained collaborative engagement to translate
between scientific terminology and local ecological vocabulary. These
translation processes revealed fundamental differences in how
environmental change is conceptualized and measured across knowledge
systems, ultimately transforming both scientific methodology and
community participation.

The integrated approach uncovered socio-ecological patterns invisible to
technical analysis alone. Community mapping identified specific
locations where formal fisheries regulations conflicted with traditional
practices, enabling targeted policy adjustments that improved both
conservation outcomes and compliance. Strong correlations between
community observations and satellite-detected changes demonstrated
potential for collaborative monitoring networks, as local observers
consistently identified environmental shifts days or weeks before
satellite detection. Recognition of traditional territorial boundaries
proved essential for improving compliance during critical spawning
periods, challenging assumptions that formal and traditional management
systems are inherently conflicting.

This study demonstrates that purely technical remote sensing approaches
miss essential social dimensions determining conservation success. The
socio-ecological systems framework developed here shows clear
transferability through standardized remote sensing protocols,
replicable participatory methods, and documented integration workflows.
Technical advances in multi-sensor integration—combining Sentinel-1
InSAR with Landsat time series and gradient-based change
detection—enhance dynamic water boundary mapping capabilities, but
achieve full potential only when integrated with participatory
validation and contextualization.

The 21-year analysis period provides a robust foundation for
understanding contemporary management challenges within Lake Chilwa’s
longer-term ecological cycles. The research demonstrates how integrating
technical precision with community knowledge creates opportunities for
adaptive governance recognizing both formal regulations and traditional
institutions. Future research should extend temporal coverage using
historical Landsat MSS data (1972-1994), integrate higher-resolution
commercial satellite data, develop coupled hydrological-social models
for scenario planning, and test methodology transferability across other
African endorheic systems. Implementation of automated early warning
systems combining satellite monitoring with community observations
offers practical pathways for collaborative conservation management in
dynamic wetland environments.
